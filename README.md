# Mafia
A digital "port," if you will, of the Mafia game, playable online.

## Run
To run the game you'll need to compile the source like any other Java program. You can create a new project in your IDE of choice, drop the `src` folder in and export as a jar, or build it manually from the command line using the "jar" utility.
